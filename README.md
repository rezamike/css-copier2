# CSS Copier  ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/test-passing-brightgreen.svg)

**CSS Copier** is an extension tool that utilizes the web page's stylesheets to help consolidate changes made to elements on the page through the Chrome browser's dev tools. It helps you consolidate all changes made in a session by hitting the start button, then tracking the changes when hitting stop, so that they will be presented in a layout easy to copy/paste if implementing the changes elsewhere.
